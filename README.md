### ðŸ‘‹ Hello I'm Realmzer or my actual name Andrew.

### About Me
I'm just a new coder trying to learn python and haxe and a bit of C# and C++ I also reshade video game sprites with photoshop. My main programming language is Haxe I think haxe is a good starting language if you are getting into coding also python because you can do almost anything in coding with python but theres a lot less features in Haxe but you can still make some pretty cool projects other than that im good. Also I'm not coding for you.

### C++ Learner
Im learning C++ because ive heard a lot of games use it that are usually 3d and want to try making a game one day.

### What I do in my free time
- Program some personal stuff
- Play video games with friends like Skate 3.
- Take walks out side
